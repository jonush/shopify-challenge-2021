# Shopify Challenge 2021

This is my submission for the Shopify 2021 Front-End Internship.

[Application - deployed with Vercel](https://shopify-challenge-2021-xi.vercel.app/)

## Details

- The project was designed in Figma and built using React and styled-components.
- No third-party component libraries were used to create the user interface.

- The application:
  - Includes routing
  - Uses axios for making requests to the API
  - Allows for loading additional results past the 10 supplied in the initial request

## Design

There are two pages included in the Figma file, documenting my process iterating over designs from v1 to v2, which was used in the final product. Version 2 was more intricate with a shallow design system used to unify the overall feel of the movie nomination experience.

## Process

1. My overall process started off in the spec sheet provided in the Google Docs and involved planning with regards to:

   - user stories (what actions did the user have to perform?)
   - what elements needed to be displayed?
   - what types of data were going to flow through the app?
   - what tech stack would efficiently satisfy these requirements?
  
2. After I had a general idea of a tech specs, I looked into the OMDB API to get a sense of what requests and responses I would be working with, as that also shaped the format that I wanted to display data through the application.

3. Then, I moved into the designing phase, first with initial low-res wireframes and concepts. I played around with different colors while trying to keep some resemblance to the Shopify brand, as the application *was for The Shoppies*. In this phase, I focused on:

   - UI components
   - responsive layout
   - colors

4. After establishing a design system and a general sense of component layout/data flow, I began with a CRA template and built out the app. For me, this phase of my process included styling and eventually testing as well.

## Future Possibilities

In the future, with more user participation I felt that there was potential to build out a back-end saving user preferences and thus showing popular nominations and other insights through some forms of data visualization on the front-end. I think those elements would have helped craft the application as more of an involved experience for the user.
